# Document 1: Analyze PR Changes

## Context

- **Playbook**: Code Review
- **Agent**: {{AGENT_NAME}}
- **Project**: {{AGENT_PATH}}
- **Date**: {{DATE}}
- **Working Folder**: {{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}

## Purpose

Understand the scope and context of the pull request before diving into detailed review.

## Pull Request Information

**Pull Request**: https://github.com/USER/PROJECT/pull/XXXX

*(Update the URL above before running this playbook)*

## Tasks

### Task 1: Fetch PR Context

- [ ] **Read the PR description**: If a PR URL is provided above, understand what the PR claims to do. Note the stated goals and any linked issues.

- [ ] **Identify the base branch**: Determine what branch this PR is targeting (usually `main` or `develop`).

### Task 2: Analyze Changed Files

- [ ] **Get the diff summary**: Run `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD` (or appropriate base branch) to see all changed files and their modification sizes.

- [ ] **Categorize changes**: Group files by type:
  - Source code files
  - Test files
  - Configuration files
  - Documentation files
  - Build/CI files

### Task 3: Understand the Scope

- [ ] **Assess PR size**: Evaluate if this is a small (< 100 lines), medium (100-500 lines), or large (> 500 lines) PR.

- [ ] **Identify high-risk areas**: Note files that:
  - Handle authentication/authorization
  - Process user input
  - Interact with databases
  - Handle financial/sensitive data
  - Modify core business logic

### Task 4: Create Scope Document

- [ ] **Write REVIEW_SCOPE.md**: Create `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/REVIEW_SCOPE.md` with:

```markdown
# PR Review Scope
